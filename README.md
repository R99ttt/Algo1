## Overview
This Java program consists of solutions to multiple questions, each implemented as separate functions. The questions cover various topics, including mathematical calculations, string manipulation, and prime number generation.

## Questions

### Question 1
The function `q1` takes an integer `n` and calculates a result based on a specific mathematical formula.

### Question 2
The class provides two functions related to checking the validity of a string containing various types of brackets:
- `q2_a`: Checks if the input string is valid in terms of bracket balancing.
- `q2_b`: Builds upon `q2_a` and additionally verifies the sequence of opening and closing brackets.

### Question 3
The function `q3` takes a positive integer `n` and generates two prime numbers based on a mathematical process.

### Question 4
The function `q4` takes a positive integer `num` and outputs valid numbers with a specific number of digits, along with their binary representations.

### Question 5
The function `q5` calculates a mathematical expression for a given integer `n`.

## Usage
To see the results of each question, run the `main` method in the `ass_1` class. Modify the loop range in the `main` method to adjust the input values for each question.

Feel free to explore and use the functions independently for specific use cases.
